        Hello! :sparkles: You found the place to submit a bug or issue that you discovered in CodeSnap, thank you for helping us out!

        Having trouble making something work in CodeSnap, but it‚Äôs not a bug with the platform itself? You‚Äôll get the fastest response by asking in our [GitHub discussions](https://github.com/RanitManik/codesnap/discussions).

        **Search our [discussions](https://github.com/RanitManik/codesnap/discussions?discussions_q=) and [issues](https://github.com/RanitManik/codesnap/issues?q=)** to see if your problem has already been reported and you can add more context, or see if someone else has already solved your issue.

        With that out of the way, let‚Äôs get started :bug:
